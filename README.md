# STIFMaps

Code from the manuscript: "STIFMap employs a convolutional neural network to reveal 
spatial mechanical heterogeneity and tension-dependent activation of an epithelial 
to mesenchymal transition within human breast cancers"

The Jupyter notebook used for building the neural networks is available via 'network_training.ipynb'. As inputs, the Jupyter notebook needs the elasticity values contained in 'stiffnesses.csv' as well as the image files available at data.mendeley.com with reserved DOI: 10.17632/vw2bb5jy99.1

The 25 completed models are available via 'trained_models' and output plots can be found in the 'output' directory.
